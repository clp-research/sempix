    "# Task: Computing Denotations\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook gives an overview of the image corpora that we have looked at so far. Many of these corpora have been used to create further annotation. Here, we only look at the corpora themselves -- that is, the types of images that can be found in them -- and the basic annotation that comes with them. Further annotations that we have looked at will be discussed in the notebooks in `03_Tasks`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is part of a collection of notebooks. The series starts with `01_SemPics` and `02_ImageCorpora` (which should be read in that order) and continues with the notebooks in the current directory, `03_Tasks`, which can be read in any order."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the perspective explained in `01_SemPics`, this notebook here looks at tasks that can be conceptualised as requiring the computation of the value of the *denotation function*, $[\\![\\cdot]\\!]$. More specifically, we will look into how we can use the expression/image relation that we find in the data, *annotates*, with that denotation relation (\n",
    "$\\mathcal{R}_{e/I} = \\{ \\mathit{annotates}, [\\![\\cdot]\\!]\\}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will look at examples of pairs of expression and image objects roughly in order of increasing size and complexity. In the tradition of formal semantics, one would set this up in such a way that the output for more complex expressions is composed out of that for its constituents. We stay agnostic with respect to the actual details of the implementation, however.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we do here is only to provide a *description* of the task and its inner structure; and to give some hints on how datasets could be constructed that make it possible to learn and evaluate models for it."

    "We should also note here that the *exhaustivity* assumption (which underlies the feasibility of negative sampling for negative instances) is potentially more doubtful here than for nouns. As we have just discussed, for nouns, we can assume that for a given object there is only a small range of appropriate names, and if an object is annotated at all, then an appropriate noun has a good chance of occurring. (Support for an argument like this could be taken from Rosch and colleagues's observation of the existence of \"base-level categories\" \\cite{Rosch1978}.) Arguably, the range of appropriate adjectives / attributes is larger, and which one is used depends more on the context, so that there might be a higher chance that an attribute is mentioned for one object, but not for another, even if it would intuitively be appropriate. It would be interesting to test this hypothesis on this data set, but we will not do that here."

    "The ReferIt corpora \\cite{Kazemzadeh2014} \\cite{yueatal:refcoco} give us expressions that were produced with the intention of referring to an individual object in a given image. Unlike the other types of expressions that we have available, they are taken from an actual, literal language game in which one player has the task to point out a pre-specified object to another player. The expressions are only recorded if the partner was then able to identify this image, and hence they are controlled for referential success. This makes the data  interesting from a *pragmatic* perspective as well, as, uniquely among the data we study here, in this setting the speaker had to make choices while clearly being oriented towards (aware of, and receiving success-feedback from) a specific addressee, in real-time. (RefCocoPlus added the constraint that the referred wasn't supposed to use positional information such as \"in the left of the image\".)\n",

    "This nicely demonstrates some properties of referring expressions in general, and also of the corpora. First we can note that the expressions are all longer than a single word. There is a good pragmatic reason for that: a category name such as \"woman\" would not have been enough here to single out the intended referent. For that, a further attribute must be mentioned. Here, for example, all expressions mention the colour of the woman's clothing. In the expressions from RefCoco, we additionally find a positional attribute (\"on right\"). (We won't find this in RefCocoPlus, because here annotators were explicitly discouraged from using positional information.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The particulars of the ReferIt setting, where only pre-segmented objects could be selected for reference, may at least partially explain another phenomenon exemplified by one of the expressions shown below. There, \"black shirt\" is used to refer to the wearer as a whole (hence the rhetorical figure used here is synecdoche). It would be another interesting question to explore whether prior assumptions about base-level categories (and hence, about the thinks that one is likely to refer to) also influence the occurrence of this phenomenon.\n",
